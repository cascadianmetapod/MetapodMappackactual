My map pack 


Breadcrumbs is a bit buggy, but my game won't allow me to do any further edits. It is however still fun and playable, but if you get the chance,
delete the ramps/trenches in the center of the map, as they are not pathable. This really isnt a big deal though and has never
come up for me when actually playing, there's just so much more of a map elsewhere.
